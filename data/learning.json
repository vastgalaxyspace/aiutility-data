      "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI architecture pattern that combines information retrieval with large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying only on what the model was trained on, RAG retrieves relevant documents from external data sources such as PDFs, databases, or knowledge bases at query time.\n\nHow RAG works:\n1. User submits a query.\n2. The query is converted into embeddings.\n3. A vector database retrieves the most relevant documents.\n4. Retrieved content is injected into the LLM prompt.\n5. The model generates a grounded, factual response.\n\nBenefits of RAG:\n• Reduces hallucinations\n• Enables up-to-date knowledge\n• Allows private and domain-specific data usage\n• Improves transparency and trust\n\nCommon use cases include chatbots, enterprise search, compliance assistants, and customer support systems.",

      "content": "Prompt engineering is the skill of writing effective instructions for AI models to get accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs.\n\nCore principles:\n1. Be Clear – Avoid vague instructions.\n2. Provide Context – Tell the AI who it is and what it should do.\n3. Specify Format – Ask for bullet points, JSON, tables, etc.\n4. Set Constraints – Limit length, tone, or scope.\n5. Iterate – Improve prompts based on outputs.\n\nExample:\nBad prompt: \"Explain AI\"\nGood prompt: \"Explain AI in simple terms for a beginner in under 100 words with examples.\"\n\nPrompt engineering is useful for writing, coding, research, automation, and AI application development.",

      "content": "Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and search high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently. They are a core component of modern AI systems, especially RAG pipelines.\n\nWhy vector databases are needed:\n• Traditional databases cannot perform semantic similarity search\n• AI models convert text, images, or audio into vectors\n• Similar meanings produce nearby vectors in embedding space\n\nKey operations:\n1. Insert embeddings\n2. Similarity search (cosine, dot-product, L2)\n3. Metadata filtering\n\nPopular vector databases include FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, and Milvus.\n\nUse cases:\n• Semantic search\n• Document retrieval\n• Recommendation systems\n• Chatbots with memory",
